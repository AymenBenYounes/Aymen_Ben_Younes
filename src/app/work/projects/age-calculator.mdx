## Overview

A simple yet effective web application that calculates a person's age based on their given birthdate.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building dynamic user interfaces and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.

## Challenges and Learnings

This project is particularly special to me as it was the first time I used React.js and Tailwind CSS in a project, even though it was a simple one. I faced some challenges with managing states initially, but as I progressed through the project, I gained valuable insights and learned a lot. It was a great experience that helped me improve my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS, and Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills in future projects.
