## Overview

Developed a responsive website for a pastry shop, showcasing its history, services, location, and contact information. The site provides an engaging user experience with a visually appealing design, ensuring easy navigation and accessibility across all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Shadcn/ui**: For building an interactive and customizable component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

I initially built this website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, but I decided to recreate it with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for better performance and maintainability. The transition felt a bit weird at first, but I managed to adapt quickly. This project also marked my first experience using the Shadcn/UI library for UI components, which helped streamline the design and improve the overall user experience.
