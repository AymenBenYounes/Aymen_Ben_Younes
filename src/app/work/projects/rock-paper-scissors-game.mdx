## Overview

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player competes against the computer, and the choices of both players (the player and the computer) are displayed, along with the score and history of the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Html**: For structuring web content.
- **Css**: For styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling logic, interactivity, and dynamic behavior.

## Challenges and Learnings

This project was a valuable learning experience, especially in terms of improving my JavaScript skills. I gained hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, handling dynamic content, and implementing interactive features. Working with JavaScript allowed me to deepen my understanding of client-side logic and how to manage user interactions efficiently.
